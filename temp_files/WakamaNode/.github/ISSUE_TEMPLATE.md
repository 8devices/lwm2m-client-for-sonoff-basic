The issue tracker is a great place to ask for enhancements and to report bugs.
If you have some questions or if you need help, some people might help you on the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/Openhab-Nodes/wakaamaNode).

Before submitting your issue, make sure:

- [ ] You've read the documentation at https://openhab-nodes.github.io/wakaamaNode, which contains some answsers to the most common problems (notably the `Limitations and know issues` and `Troubleshooting` pages)
- [ ] You're using the examples bundled in *your* release, which are in the `examples/` folder of the `.zip` of the release you're using. Examples might not be backward-compatible

Thanks!
